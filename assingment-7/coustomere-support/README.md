# React Quick Notes

**1. JSX:** It looks like HTML but inside JS. Used in React to build UI easily.  

**2. State vs Props:** State is local data inside a component. Props is how parent passes data to child.  

**3. useState hook:** Lets you add state in functional components. Changing state updates the UI.  

**4. Sharing state:** Keep state in parent and send it to child via props or use Context API.  

**5. Event handling:** React uses camelCase events and you give a function to handle them.
